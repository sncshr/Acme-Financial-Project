Requirements Document: Cash and Stock Transactions in an Account
1. Introduction
Acme Financial Services is expanding its transactional accounts application! The system will now track and manage cash and stock holdings within an account, ensuring accuracy in asset valuation, categorization, and transaction history.
2. Existing Functionality
In the current iteration of this application, only cash transactions are supported. In addition, only the current balance is tracked, and therefore, no transaction history is available. 
3. Transaction History 
When option “6. Get History” is selected from the Acme Financial Menu, all deposits and withdrawals initiated within this session will be listed in the order that they were entered. 
 
4. Stocks
Stocks are a new type of asset to be implemented. They are tracked using a price and the number of units held. All deposits and withdraw transactions will be done with the number of units specified, and it must be a discrete integer. For this iteration of Acme Financial Services application, all stocks deposited and withdrawn will be defaulted to the stock ACME, where the price is always $5 per share. 
 
5. Account Balance
When option “5. Check Balance” is selected from the Acme Financial Menu, the application will calculate the account balance as follows:

Cash Balance = Total Cash Deposits – Total Cash Withdraws

Stock Balance = (Total Stock Deposits – Total Stock Withdraws) * Price

Total Balance = Cash Balance + Stock Balance 
 
7. Out of Scope
•	Implementation of specific stocks other than the default.
•	Implementation of any transaction type other than cash and stock.
•	Saving/persistence of data to a file or database. Information is reset when the application is closed.
